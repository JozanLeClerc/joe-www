				<h1>My computing experience</h1>
				<p>
					These are the things I use in my day-to-day computing
					experience both at home and work. As I enjoy working
					from my computer and tweaking it, I recommend them all.
				</p>
				<p>
					My configuration files for some of these softwares can
					be found on my
					<a href="https://gitjoe.xyz/jozan/dotfiles-bsd/tree/">dotfiles</a>
					repo on GitJoe. My wallapers can be found on
					<a href="files.html">this page</a>.

				<h2>Software</h2>
				<p>
					<div class="figure">

						<p>My neofetch</p>
					</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Text editing</h4>
							Custom configured <b>GNU Emacs</b> to be used
							with vim key bindings. It is not the most
							lightweight editor out there but I love my
							config for all kind of coding or text editing.
							I use the GUI version.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>OS</h4>
							<b>FreeBSD 13</b> is my OS of choice. I left
							GNU/Linux for BSD about 1 year ago and I never
							felt the need to go back!
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Window manager</h4>
							<b>dwm</b> is my favorite tiling window manager
							and the only one I use for it is very light and
							highly extensible.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Terminal emulator</h4>
							<b>st</b> is my favorite terminal emulator.
							Just like <b>dwm</b>, it's very light and highly
							extensible.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Shell</h4>
							I use <b>zsh</b> as my only interactive shell.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Other software</h4>
							Here is a small list of programs I use frequently.
							Most are terminal-based.
							<ul>
								<li>
									web browser: <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> for
									most web browsing. I also use <b>w3m</b>
									and <b>lynx</b> quite a lot.
								</li>
								<li>file manager: <b>lf</b></li>
								<li>image viewer: <b>nsxiv</b></li>
								<li>video player: <b>mpv</b></li>
								<li>music player: <b>mpd</b> + <b>ncmpc</b></li>
								<li>pdf viewer: <b>zathura</b></li>
								<li>RSS feed reader: <b>newsboat</b></li>
								<li>email client: <b>neomutt</b> running with <b>isync</b> and <b>msmtp</b></li>
								<li>address book: <b>abook</b></li>
								<li>calendar: <b>calcurse</b>
								<li>IRC client: <b>irssi</b>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Games</h4>
							I haven't played much video games in recent times
							but here's what I used to play a lot:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Kerbal Space Program</b> on my Linux
									machine, I loved this game!
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Classic DOOM</b> and <b>Hexen</b>
									through <b>gzdoom</b>, it runs very
									smooth on BSD.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>Hardware</h2>
				<p>
					My computer is a ThinkPad T530 and I love it. Unfortunately
					I bought it used and the previous owner forgot to tell me
					there was an ugly turtle tattooed on the rear side. This is
					my only complain. It's not too visible but it's there. The
					deal was quick, there was not much lighting and the seller
					opened the screen right away, so I didn't see that ugly
					turtle until I was home with my new computer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is the hardware config:
					<ul>
						<li>Intel i5-3320M 2.60GHz, 4 threads</li>
						<li>8GB RAM</li>
						<li>500GB SSD</li>
						<li>1TB HDD</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					I know it's not crazy good but I can do all my work and
					my media consumption with it so I consider myself a
					tech-happy guy.
				</p>

					<p>The ugly turtle</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Other notable hardware</h3>
				<p>
					I have a <b>RaspberryPi 4</b> I received from a friend as a
					christmas gift. It runs FreeBSD of course. I use it to
					learn I2C/GPIO programming with a bit of electronics. I am
					looking for some projects for it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a <b>Casio F-91W</b> watch gifted by a friend too so
					I never loose time. Adult people tend to show more respect
					towards people wearing watches too, just like they do with
					people with wives or kids, so there's that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last piece of hardware worth noting is my keyboard: a
					<a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=169">
						Leopold
					</a>
					<b>FC900R PD</b> with <b>Cherry MX Brown</b> switches. It is
					so good I plan on buying maybe 5 of them in the future so I
					don't need to worry and I can just use it the same model
					for all my life. I might check some of the
					<a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp</a>
					<b>Model M</b> remakes when they are available again.
